# Hyperparameter Optimization Using Optuna with PyTorch

## Overview

This repository demonstrates hyperparameter optimization using the **Optuna** framework in conjunction with **PyTorch**. The example focuses on optimizing. The optimization process includes tuning the neural network architecture and the optimizer configuration to maximize validation accuracy.

## What is Hyperparameter Optimization?

Hyperparameter optimization is a critical step in the development of machine learning models. Hyperparameters are external to the model itself and control the training process, such as the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and more. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during training, hyperparameters must be set before the training process begins. The right set of hyperparameters can significantly improve a model's performance, making the optimization process crucial for achieving state-of-the-art results.

Traditional methods for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search, can be inefficient and time-consuming. Advanced techniques like Bayesian optimization, which adaptively selects the best hyperparameters based on past trials, can greatly enhance the efficiency of this process.

## What is Optuna?

**Optuna** is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework designed for efficiency, flexibility, and ease of use. It supports a variety of optimization algorithms, including Bayesian optimization, Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), and multi-objective optimization. Optuna allows for dynamic construction of the search space and pruning of unpromising trials, significantly speeding up the optimization process.

Key features of Optuna include:

- **Automatic Pruning:** Automatically stops unpromising trials early, saving computational resources.
- **Flexible Search Spaces:** Easily define complex search spaces with conditional parameters.
- **Visualization Tools:** Built-in tools to visualize optimization results and search space behavior.
- **Integration with Popular Libraries:** Seamlessly integrates with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and more.

By leveraging Optuna, this repository aims to efficiently identify the best hyperparameters for the neural network model used in the dataset, thus enhancing the overall model performance.

## Key Features

- **Optuna Integration:** Utilizes Optuna, a powerful and flexible hyperparameter optimization framework.
- **Dynamic Neural Network Architecture:** Optimizes the number of layers, hidden units per layer, and dropout ratios.
- **Optimizer Tuning:** Tunes the learning rate and selects the best optimizer from a set of popular choices.
